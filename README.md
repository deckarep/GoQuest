# In Development, not ready.

A simple room-based adventure game the world can play.

GoQuest is based on old-school text adventure game ideals using new-school technologies.  Think of it as a fun game/experiment where anyone can play/contribute.  

It all starts with one room:  You are standing in a dimly lit rooom. You see a passageway to the north that is largley covered in dense vines.  To the west is towering door, dressed in beautiful rubys of varying color.  The east lies a corridoor lit by torches.  The south, lies...blah, blah.
